My receiver has 4 parts. single_receiver and double_receiver share same parts.
-part1 : check file numbers
-part2 : get message number, packet number, word and check they are valid
-part3 : insert the message in the list
-part4 : after all insertion, print messages one by one
In part 1, my receiver checks whether there are two files or not.
In part 2, I think that message number and packet number should be positive integers. So my receiver will check them whether the arguments are positive integers or not.
And if there are any problems in input(missing packet number, missing word, etc.), my receiver gives error messages to the user and ignore the input.
In part 3, my receiver uses multiple singly/doublly list.

These are the test results

<single receiver> 
Running Time: 1 s.

<double receiver>
Running Time: 1 s.

Two receiver program exhibit similar time. This is because except the functions of singly/doubly list, two receiver cpp file are almost same. They use same scheme to 
solve the packet network problem. However, because the insert_before function of doubly list is more efficient than insert_before function of singly list, one can get
better performance in double receiver if the input size become larger.
