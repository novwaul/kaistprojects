Insert functions of singly/doubly list check duplication. Because the insert functions uses pointer, the duplicated insertion will cause serious problems.
For example, if user change some values in second element of the list, then he or she may unintentionally chagne the values of third element of the list
which is actually same node(second element and third element are same one node). Therefore, my insert functions check duplication to prevent such errors.

Other functions are implemented according to the requirements of instuctions.
