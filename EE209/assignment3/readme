About extra points : Hash Table expansion is implemented in RegisterCustomer()
Explanation of the test results : 
-Array
> pros : It was fast than Hash Table in test 4. Array is faster than Hash in seeing 
         entire nodes at once. I explained the reason of this result in "-Hash Table > cons".
> cons : It was slow except test4. Becasue Array has to see all nodes, it takes more time
         than Hash Table, usually.
-Hash Table
> pros : Considering Array data structure, all test results except test4 is faster
         than the results of Array. Becasue Hash Table don't have to see all nodes, it can 
         reduce a lot of time than Array, usually.
> cons : Test result of test 4 is slower than the result of test 4 of Array. Array and Hash 
         Table see the same number of nodes. But Hash Table has to do extra works to see the nodes.
         (For example, before hash see nodes, it has to see whether bucket has nodes or not. 
         However, array can see nodes directly.) Therefore, Hash Table is slower than Array in 
         seeing entire nodes at once.
         Also, register speed is quite slower than the other functions in Hash Table. Because
         register function has to expand Hash Table, it needs more time than the other functions.
